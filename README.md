Day 2: 8/24/2023
Day 3: 8/25/2023
Day 4: 8/26/2023: How to Insert Parameters into methods and accept the input using scanner
Day 5: 8/27/2023: Java Method Overloading(Creating Multiple Method with same name and function, datatype is the only thin that varies)
Day 6: 8/28/2023: Pattern Design Programming(Creating rows and col using for loop inside a for loop)
Day 7: 8/29/2023: Java Recursion(Using a method to call itself to solve cummulative/permutation in maths)
Day 8: 8/30/2023: Object Oriented Programming: Classes, Objects, Accessing Attributes(class representation of variable)
Day 9: 8/31/2023: Java Class Constructor: Creating a class to initialize variables in the Main Method + First instance of abstract class//(not yet fully understood)//
Day 10: 9/1/2023: A java function that takes two integer variables(attributes) and multiplies them
Day 11: 9/2/2023: Java OOP paradigm concepts and meaning(txt) Java Encapsulation: using PUBLIC get name and set name to read and make changes to a private variable in a public class
Day 12: 9/8/2023: exercises on string method type and integer method type
Day 13: 9/12/2023: Java Package and API: Packaging is a means of grouping a particular set of codes in a folder e.g package Day14;
package Day15; ...You must have seen this in previous codes, in order to access them, the import method is used
Day 14: Created OOP class, variables and methods in Car.java....Created the object in MainMain.java to access those attributes of public class Car
Day 15: 9/16/2023: Java Package Retesting; Inheritance and Encapsulation(different commit, different tests)
Day 16: 9/18/2023: Encapsulation and Inheritance Pt2; Variable Swapper using OOP;
Day 17: 9/20/2023: Java Polymorphism; created a parent class(School) with various childclass(Classes)
//THERE IS WORK TO BE DONE HERE//...DONE!
Java Inner Class: Nested class inside a class(Solved 1/3 issues in day17.main): Created a inner class for students. To be completed over the next couple days
Day 18: 9/21/2023: Abstract Classes and Methods:
//apply to day17.Main.java//
Day19:9/22/2023: Abstract classes and methods: //Redo day17.main using inner class and abstract method.
Day 20: 9/25/2023: Created a method for calcuating number of students registered for each subclass under super class(School)
//StudentsCount does not increase beyond 1
Day 21: 9/26/2023: Java Interface: Just like abstract, methods of an interface does not have a body and is inherited using the keyword implements.  JAVA enum(Enumeration): special class for grouping constant(unchangeable variables) variables in the enum class can be used in a switch statement
Day 22: Java Scanner Input, LocalDate and Time. How to use DateTimeFormatter
Day 23: 9/28/2023: ArrayList(how to lop, sort, change elements of an arrayList and more)
Day 24: 9/29/2023: Java HashMap: Storing data in form of a table with two columns
Day 25: 9/30/2023: Java Iterator: Iterator function for looping through ArrayList 
Day 26: 10/1/2023: Wrapper Class(How to use primitive data types as objects i.e Integer instead of int, Boolean instead of boolean, String remains the same) Collections like ArrayList, LinkedList can only store objects like Integer, Boolean, String...Java Exceptions(try and catch), (throw)
Day 27: 10/2/2023: JAva Regular Expression
