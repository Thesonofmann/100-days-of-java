Day 4: 8/26/2023: How to Insert Parameters into methods and accept the input using scanner
Day 5: 8/27/2023: Java Method Overloading(Creating Multiple Method with same name and function, datatype is the only thin that varies)
Day 6: 8/28/2023: Pattern Design Programming(Creating rows and col using for loop inside a for loop)
Day 7: 8/29/2023: Java Recursion(Using a method to call itself to solve cummulative/permutation in maths)
Day 8: 8/30/2023: Object Oriented Programming: Classes, Objects, Accessing Attributes(class representation of variable)
Day 9: 8/31/2023: Java Class Constructor: Creating a class to initialize variables in the Main Method + First instance of abstract class//(not yet fully understood)//
Day 10: 9/1/2023: A java function that takes two integer variables(attributes) and multiplies them
Day 11: 9/2/2023: Java OOP paradigm concepts and meaning(txt) Java Encapsulation: using PUBLIC get name and set name to read and make changes to a private variable in a public class
Day 12: 9/8/2023: exercises on string method type and integer method type
Day 13: 9/12/2023: Java Package and API: Packaging is a means of grouping a particular set of codes in a folder e.g package Day14;
package Day15; ...You must have seen this in previous codes, in order to access them, the import method is used
Day 14: Created OOP class, variables and methods in Car.java....Created the object in MainMain.java to access those attributes of public class Car
Day 15: 9/16/2023: Java Package Retesting; Inheritance and Encapsulation(different commit, different tests)
Day 16: 9/18/2023: Encapsulation and Inheritance Pt2; Variable Swapper using OOP;
Day 17: 9/20/2023: Java Polymorphism; created a parent class(School) with various childclass(Classes)
//THERE IS WORK TO BE DONE HERE//...DONE!
Java Inner Class: Nested class inside a class(Solved 1/3 issues in day17.main): Created a inner class for students. To be completed over the next couple days
Day 18: 9/21/2023: Abstract Classes and Methods:
//apply to day17.Main.java//
Day19:9/22/2023: Abstract classes and methods: //Redo day17.main using inner class and abstract method.
Day 20: 9/25/2023: Created a method for calcuating number of students registered for each subclass under super class(School)
//StudentsCount does not increase beyond 1
Day 21: 9/26/2023: Java Interface: Just like abstract, methods of an interface does not have a body and is implemented (inherited) using the keyword implements.  
JAVA enum(Enumeration): special class for grouping constant(unchangeable variables) variables in the enum class can be used in a switch statement
Day 22: Java Scanner Input, LocalDate and Time. How to use DateTimeFormatter
Day 23: 9/28/2023: ArrayList(how to lop, sort, change elements of an arrayList and more)
Day 24: 9/29/2023: Java HashMap: Storing data in form of a table with two columns
Day 25: 9/30/2023: Java Iterator: Iterator function for looping through ArrayList 
Day 26: 10/1/2023: Wrapper Class(How to use primitive data types as objects i.e Integer instead of int, Boolean instead of boolean, String remains the same bc it is not a primitive data type) Collections like ArrayList, LinkedList can only store objects like Integer, Boolean, String...Java Exceptions(try and catch), (throw)
Day 27: 10/2/2023: JAva Regular Expressions
Day 28: 10/3/2023: Java Threads 1.) Initializing a thread as a class(extends)  2.) Implementing threads as an interface(implements){Multiple methods}++++ Multi-threading

Lambda Expressions//Check amigoscode yt for breakdown
Day 29: 10/4/2023: File Handling(C.R.U.D)(Creating Files, Writing to a File, Reading Files,Deleting Files and Folder)

Day 31: 10/14/2023: String types and literals
Day 32: 10/15/2023: Control flow(Iteration, exception handling)
Day 33: 10/16/2023: A couple of correction to the chapter 1(Java Fundamentals)
Day 34: 10/17/2023: Varags //solution to issues on day2// 
Day 35: 10/18/2023: Constructors: Breakdown of day9
Day 36: 10/19/2023: VARARGS: creating a method to accept and print an array of strings
Day 37: 10/28/2023: How to apply the toString() method, overriding methods pt1
Day 38: 11/10/2023: Instance and static methods, attributes and properties
Day 39: 11/11/2023: Interface
