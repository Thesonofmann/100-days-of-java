JAVAHASHMAP

    Remember in rdbms, data is stored in forms of tables, the data in a row can be called/accessed by calling the Key value i.e studentRegNo will provide all info about the student.


    HashMap is similar to arrayList, it stores the index along with the data in the array. And the key Value(index) can be different objectType(int, String)
